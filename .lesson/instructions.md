# Functions

### Define

Although Python is not _stricto sensu_ a functional language, functions play an important role in it. Functions are pieces of code that take an input and return an output. They are _defined_ once and _invoked_ typically more than once.

Definition of a function requires the keyword `def` and the `:`.
